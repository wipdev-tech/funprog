# funutils

**Add functional programming to your Go code**

Package `funutils` includes functions implementing common functional
programming concepts and patterns. The name was inspired from an R
documentation page named
[funprog](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/funprog).
(I am not the only one who sees the "fun" in the "functional")

The package includes functions like:
- map
- filter
- reduce
- composition
- ... and many more
