# funutils

**Add functional programming to your Go code**

Package `funutils` includes functions implementing common functional
programming concepts and patterns. The name was inspired from an R
documentation page named
[funprog](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/funprog).
(I am not the only one who sees the "fun" in the "functional")

The package includes functions like:
- map
- filter
- reduce
- composition
- ... and many more

**NOTE:** This package is a simple collection of utility functions. For a more
fleshed out FP implementation, check out [fp-go](https://github.com/IBM/fp-go).

## Installation

Following the [Go proverb](https://go-proverbs.github.io/) _"a little copying
is better than a little dependency,"_ I encourage you to browse code and if you
only need a function or two from here, just copy them into your project.

If you decide you want the whole package, simply use `go get` in your project
directory:

```bash
go get github.com/wipdev-tech/funprog
```
